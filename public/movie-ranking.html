  <h3>The Darkest Minds</h3>
    <p>Brings back nostalgia from my teenage years. It portrays beautiful connections with the characters and how their 
    differences can be used to create a powerful entity.</p>

  <h3>Van Heilsing</h3>
    <p>Old sci-fi movie that has a great take on vampires and werewolves. It has great characters and some dark humour
    sprinkled here and there.</p>
 
  <h3>Red One</h3>
   <p>A different take on Christmas. It is a movie about how an evil witch tried to steal Santa Claus and Dwayne Johnson
    along with Captain America try to get him back.</p>
